# plantGPT
># Introduction

plantGPT(a plant genomic prediction model based on Transformer), a Transformer-based model, can be used to predict phenotypes using genomic data.

Instructions and examples are provided in the following tutorials.
># Requirement
```
Python 3.9.18
PyTorch >= 1.5.0
numpy
pandas
sklearn
random
math
tqdm
```
## Input file
```
the first  snp  dataset.
the second  phenotype dataset.
```
## Output file
```
After the plantGPT model, the model will be save at: "log/plantGPT.tar".
The latent representations for each modality  are saved in the log/mod1.npy,log/mod2.npy
```
